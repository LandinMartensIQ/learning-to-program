# Assignment #1 | Data Types

This assignment will help verify your understanding of the different core data types and strings that C# uses such as int, long, float, decimal, string and more.

# Requirements Before Starting

* Understanding of Data Types `(int, decimal, bool, etc)`
* Basic `If` statements
* Basic `Try & Catch` statements
* Possibly googling how to do things in C# as you run into roadblocks - expected!
  * Googling things and doing self research is a core aspect of being a programmer
  * If you still are having a hard time, ask me for help

# Setup Instructions

* Open `Git Bash` (windows search for it)
* Type `cd C:\Git\learning-to-program` and hit enter
* Type `git checkout -b <your_name_here_without_arrows>_Assignment_1` and hit enter
  * For example if I were to do this, it would be `git checkout -b LandinM_Assignment_1`
  * This command will create a local branch that is a copy of everything I have created
* Type `git push -u origin <your_name_here_without_arrows>_Assignment_1` and hit enter
  * For example if I were to do this, it would be `git push -u origin LandinM_Assignment_1`
  * This command will push your local branch creating a remote branch
* Open this folder `cd C:\Git\learning-to-program\1 - DataTypes` in file explorer
* Open `DataTypes.csproj` in visual studio 2019

# Assignment Instructions

* With the project open within visual studio, using the solution panel open Tests/WeirdCalculator_Tests.cs.
* Right click on the class -> run tests.
  * A test pane should open and show you all them are failing.
  * If you don't see this, please call me over for help - this should 'just work'.
* The comment above the tests within the test class will guide you through the test.
* You will find comments within Code/WeirdCalculator.cs
  * These will give you some context / food for thought and high level hints for more complex things.
  
# Submission Instructions

* When you are done and ready for review you need to push your changes so I can see them.
* Open `Git Bash` (windows search for it)
* Type `cd C:\Git\learning-to-program` and hit enter
* Type `git add .` and hit enter
  * This will stage your all changes in your local branch
* Type `git commit -m "Assignment Changes"` and hit enter
  * This will create a commit with all the staged files in your local branch
* Type `git push`
  * This will push your local commit(s) to your remote branch
* Let me know which assignment you have done and I will take a look and review it.
