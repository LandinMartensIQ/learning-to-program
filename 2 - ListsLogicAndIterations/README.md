# Assignment #2 | Lists, Logic and Iterations

This assignment will help you understand and process arrays and linked lists that use ICollection and are fundamental for holding data for most of what you will do in future programs.

# Requirements Before Starting

* Understanding of the following types `(Array, List<T>, Dictionary)`
* Basic iterations (for, foreach)
* Possibly googling how to do things in C# as you run into roadblocks - expected!
  * Googling things and doing self research is a core aspect of being a programmer
  * If you still are having a hard time, ask me for help

# Setup Instructions

* Open `Git Bash` (windows search for it)
* Type `cd C:\Git\learning-to-program` and hit enter
* Type `git checkout -b <your_name_here_without_arrows>_Assignment_2` and hit enter
* Type `git push -u origin <your_name_here_without_arrows>_Assignment_2` and hit enter
* Open this folder `cd C:\Git\learning-to-program\2 - ListsLogicAndIterations` in file explorer
* Open `ListsLogicAndIterations.csproj` in visual studio 2019

# Assignment Instructions

* With the project open within visual studio, you need to implement the code within the `Code` folder
* Implement the code files and get the test passing in the following order:
  * Arrays_Tests
  * Lists_Test
  * Dictionarys_Test
  * LogicAndInterations_Tests
  
# Submission Instructions

* When you are done and ready for review you need to push your changes so I can see them.
* Open `Git Bash` (windows search for it)
* Type `cd C:\Git\learning-to-program` and hit enter
* Type `git add .` and hit enter
  * This will stage your all changes in your local branch
* Type `git commit -m "Assignment Changes"` and hit enter
  * This will create a commit with all the staged files in your local branch
* Type `git push`
  * This will push your local commit(s) to your remote branch
* Let me know which assignment you have done and I will take a look and review it.
