# Assignment #5+ | RPG

The goal of **ALL** future assignments is to slowly build a small RPG based upon what a client wants (Role Playing Game - think Skyrim, Fallout, DND, etc - but a lot smaller in scale). *Every single assignment going forward will add to the code you write for assignment `5.1 - Character Builder`.* Each assignment should be code reviewed by your mentor **BEFORE** moving onto future assignments. The program will get to large to easily code review if you do them all at once and then ask for a code review.

If you introduce bugs into your code, write code that is hard to maintain or write code that is hard to understand; You will feel the impact of your choices first hand. When you discover areas that can be improved because they are hard to extend, have bugs or is just something you don't like anymore - you should refactor (change) the code! Maintaining a program that changes over time is a great way discover your own flow of programming while also giving first hand experience on why some design or code choices are difficult to maintain.
