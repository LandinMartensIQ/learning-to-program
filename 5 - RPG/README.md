# Assignment #5 - RPG

The goal of **ALL** remaining assignments is to slowly build a small RPG based upon what a client wants. A RPG is a Role Playing Game - think Skyrim, Fallout, DND, etc. Of course what you will build will a lot smaller in scale.

*Every single assignment going forward will add to the code you will eventually write for assignment `5.1 - Character Builder`.* For this reason, there will not be an assignment 6, just changes to your existing assignment 5. This is why all assignments have a decimal, for example `5.1`, `5.2`, etc. Each assignment should be code reviewed by your mentor **BEFORE** moving onto future assignments. The program will get large and won't be easily to code review if you do all assignments at once and then ask for a code review.

If you introduce bugs into your code, take short cuts, write code that is hard to maintain or write code that is hard to understand; You will feel the impact of your choices first hand and this is important. With that said, as the requirements will come over the course of multiple assignments you will need to make calls for how much effort to put into things as you don't know upfront exactly how your code will be used later.

When you discover areas that can be improved because they are hard to extend, have bugs or simply is not how you like anymore - you should refactor (change & improve) the code! Maintaining a program that changes over time is a great way discover your own flow of programming while also giving first hand experience on why some design or code choices are difficult to maintain.

# High Level Requirements

* Understanding of `OOP, C#, Visual Studio Projects, DLL (Library) vs EXE`
* Creating projects for various aspects of the system
* Creating unit tests that covers and tests your code as you see fit
* Possibly googling how to do things in C# as you run into roadblocks - this is expected

# Setup Instructions

* Open `Git Bash` (windows search for it)
* Type `cd C:\Git\learning-to-program` and hit enter
* Type `git add .` and hit enter
* Type `git stash` and hit enter
* Type `git checkout master` and hit enter
* Type `git pull` and hit enter
* Type `git checkout -b <your_name_here_without_arrows>_RPG_CharacterBuilder` and hit enter
* Type `git push -u origin <your_name_here_without_arrows>_RPG_CharacterBuilder` and hit enter

# Assignments

* Within your browser that you are using to view these instructions, you should see folders like `5.# - <assignment name>`
* Each assignment folder has a `readme.md` that will display requirements and instructions just like these instructions
* Each assignments setup and instructions will assume you have done the previous assignments so don't skip assignments
* The first assignment is `5.1 - Character Builder`, open this folder and view the instructions within your browser
* When you are done the first assignment and you are done the code review, move on to assignment `5.2`, then `5.3` and so on
